Uhhhh it's a school thing don't ask

# Using BeaverDam

1) Pull this git
2) Install dependencies `npm install pkg.json`
3) Run the server `node ./TheBeaverDam.js`
4) Head to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser and you will be connected to the BeaverDam Gateway

# Using the Gateway

There are 2 controls: Add and Remove

When adding a log to the Stack, you will need to specify the dimensions and type of wood of the log.
